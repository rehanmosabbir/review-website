              education blogging in Bangladesh. So far, Rehan's Educare has

              times as he wants) in many of its courses.

              At Rehan's Educare, we believe there is a better way to provide
              education. A more interesting and effective way where students can
              learn rather than just attend classes. We’re obsessively
              passionate about it, and our mission is to help students achieve
              their dream. We focus on students’ learning. Learning has been the
              least emphasized aspect of our education and we see that as an
              opportunity: We’re excited to simplify Education for everyone
              through our guidance, care, and inspiration.
